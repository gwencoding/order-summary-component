## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn how to use flexbox.

Code snippets below:

```css
.plan-box{
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  border-radius: 12px;
  display:flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding:25px;
}
```

### Continued development

Learning flexbox was new to me and I need to practise more on this tool for future projects. I want to be able to master html and css.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Acknowledgments

For this project I recommend to understand flexbox with a guide or games like Flexbox Froggy, Flexbox Defense. If you're stuck you can check solutions on Frontend Mentor or Youtube to take inspiration but don't forget that there are different codes to reach the same solution.
